# 🤖 Minecraft AFK Bot (Mineflayer-Based)

This is a lightweight Minecraft Java AFK Bot powered by [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer). It connects to a Java server, performs basic movements to avoid AFK detection, and can be customized via a simple configuration file.

## ⚠️ Notes

* **Skins**: Skins might not appear properly if the server is in offline mode.
* **Sneak Movement**: The bot uses `setControlState('sneak', true)`, but some servers may block or ignore this action.
* **AFK Prevention**: The bot periodically moves, sneaks, and jumps to prevent disconnection due to inactivity.
